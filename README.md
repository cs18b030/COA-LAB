## COA Lab Project:  
- Implemented trap handler, timer interrupt, switching privilege levels and performing system calls in supervisor mode in ASM.  
- Coded an assembly program for software with specified privilege levels, read-write-execute restrictions and an MMU with given page size.  
- Built a program to demonstrate physical memory protection and page miss handling.  
- Executed above programs on spike(RISC V ISA simulator) and debugged them using GDB and OpenOCD.
